    <h1>Ways of Seeing - John Berger</h1>

    <p>The episode I found most interesting was the first. I love going to art museums and my parents have indulged me in this since I was young. But while I adore looking at them in person, I have never felt that my experience of a painting was diminished
        when looking at it online or on a printout. I was always confused whenever I said my favorite painting is Van Gogh's Starry Night and someone would tell me that it couldn't be since I hadn't seen it in person yet. To be perfectly honest, this
        particular comment made my first experience of seeing it kind of anticlimactic. It was beautiful yet small and I found myself preferring the Mulberry Tree at the Norton Simon museum I frequented as a kid.

    <div>In the first episode, John Berger quite perfectly deconstructed my thoughts concerning these conflicting feelings regarding art.

    <blockquote>"The meaning of a painting no longer resides on it's unique painted surface, which it is only possible to see in one place at one time. It's meaning, or a large part of it has become transmittable. It comes to you, this meaning, like the news of an
        event. It has become information of a sort."</blockquote>
